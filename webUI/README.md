# Web UI

## How to build

- First install nodejs (Using node version manager is the best way in my opinion)
- Then cd into webUI folder
- Run the command 'npm install' (This will install the dependencies and only needs to be done once to build)

## How to run
- First start up protoswarm
- Open a new terminal and cd into the webUI folder
- Run the command 'node index.js'
- Follow the terminal output
- Use the password indicated at the top of index.js and press the buttons to interact!
